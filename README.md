## Project Overview

The Grocery-Tracking Program is a C++ application developed for the Corner Grocer Project 3 to analyze text records generated throughout the day. The program provides insights into item frequency, helping the store optimize its layout for improved customer experience.

## Design and Functionality

The program is structured using a class-based approach, with the `GroceryTracker` class encapsulating all functionality. Key features include:

- **Reading Input File:** The program reads item data from a text file, `CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt`, and stores item frequencies in a map data structure.
- **Menu Options:** Users can choose from four menu options:
  1. Search for an item
  2. View item frequency list
  3. View item frequency histogram
  4. Exit
- **Data Backup:** Item frequencies are written to a backup file, `frequency.dat`, for data preservation.

## Optional Challenge: User Input Validation

Input validation and error handling have been implemented to ensure a smooth user experience. Users are prompted to enter a valid choice between 1 and 4, with error messages displayed for invalid input.

## Conclusion

The Grocery-Tracking Program demonstrates proficiency in writing professional, well-documented, and efficient code using C++. It fulfills the functional requirements specified for the Corner Grocer project and provides valuable insights for optimizing store layout and customer satisfaction.
